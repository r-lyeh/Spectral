## About
Spectral is an experimental emulator that I have been randomly assembling [since the pandemic days](https://twitter.com/r_rlyeh/status/1280964279903158273), inspired by my old fZX32 emulator. Accuracy and performance are long-term goals, but the primary focus is just having fun with this thing. Hardcore ZX users will find little value in this emulator right now, but I hope newbies may find its ease of use somehow appealing to try.
That being said, Spectral has a very compatible TAP/TZX loader and some other interesting features that provide me some fun in these days.
Code is highly experimental and prone to change in the future. I will keep altering/breaking things randomly for good sake.

## Downloads
Download any binary release from the [bin/ folder](bin/).

Alternatively, you can build the emulator yourself:

- Linux/MacOS users can run `sh MAKE.bat` instead.

## Usage
Spectral can be configured with a mouse.

Here are some keyboard shortcuts, though:
- ESC: Game browser
- F1: CPU throttle (hold)
- F2: Start/stop tape
- F3/F4: Rewind/advance tape
- F5: Reload game
- F6: Toggle input latency (Run-a-head)
- F7: Toggle issue 2/3
- F8: Toggle tape speed
- F9: Toggle TV/RF (4 modes)
- F9+SHIFT: Toggle AY core (2 modes)
